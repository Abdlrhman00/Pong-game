# Pong-game
Welcome to our AI-Powered Pong Game project! This repository contains the source code for a classic Pong game implemented in Python using the Pygame library. What sets our Pong game apart is its integration with AI, allowing players to challenge a computer-controlled opponent in exciting paddle-and-ball action.

## Features
- player vs. computer mode (AI)
- Simple and intuitive user interface
- Score tracking for both players

  
## Usage
- Use the arrow keys to control the paddles.
- In player vs. computer mode, the computer opponent's paddle will move automatically to track the ball.
- Try to hit the ball past your opponent's paddle to score points.
- The game ends when one player reaches the specified winning score.
